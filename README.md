This repository contains code showcasing the process of training an AI model to play chess. The model utilizes a combination of data preprocessing and sequence-to-sequence learning techniques.

Overview
The key steps involved in this process are:

Data Preparation: Chess game data is collected, cleaned, and formatted for training. Moves are applied to FEN (Forsythâ€“Edwards Notation) positions.

Tokenization and Preprocessing: FEN positions and corresponding moves are tokenized using a transformer-based model. Data is preprocessed for model input.

Model Training: A sequence-to-sequence model is initialized and trained on the preprocessed chess data to predict optimal moves given board positions.

Getting Started
TensorFlow and TPU Initialization
The script initializes TensorFlow and configures it to use TPUs for distributed training. Necessary packages are installed using pip.

Data Loading and Cleaning
Chess tactic evaluation data is read from a CSV file, cleaned, and manipulated to prepare it for model training. Rows with null values are handled appropriately.

FEN Position Manipulation
Functions are implemented to apply moves to FEN positions and split FEN strings into meaningful parts. Numeric parts of FEN strings are converted into corresponding letters for better tokenization.

Tokenization and Preprocessing
The FEN and New FEN columns are joined, formatted, and tokenized for model input. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and a preprocessing function is applied to tokenize the data.

Model Training
A pre-trained sequence-to-sequence model is fine-tuned on the tokenized dataset using TensorFlow. The model is compiled, and training progresses with TensorFlow datasets for both training and testing sets.

Usage
To run the code, follow these steps:

Clone the repository.
Install the required packages.
Execute the main script.
Results
After training, the model can predict optimal moves based on board positions.
